Hi
<br>
Project Name : QWERTY
<br>
This site will assist you to meet your diet goals. No, we are not saying you to pull up the apron and make a rich diet for you, we can all do it by the daily available food in your hostel mess or things made at your home. We all need is just little addtion or small changes in your eating habits. Through which you will be able to reach your health goals without even an extra effort. 
<br>
We will take some normal inputs from you such as your height, weight, age, gender, the diet goal to which you are heading towards, be it a sedentary lifestyle or fat loss journey, and the most important thing i.e. your FOOD MENU.
<br>
After calculating the required amount of calories, macro-nutrient, water intake etc.  your body need, we will not give you an imaginary diet plan but instead we will try to DESIGN your meal by the foods available to you to reach your diet goal. Ofcourse we need some toppings over it but we will try to maximise the use of the available foods instaed of an addition.
<br>
Our basic idea to achieve this will be by changing the portion sizes for you, notify you to include that untouched salad or the disaster curry. And in case consider a scenario, that if it is difficult to find a healthy fat source for you from the accessible options we will recommend you to have your favorite fat source along such as ghee, nuts, butter etc.. 
<br>
In this way we will take the maximum use of the available things and some additions to actually cater you a great meal.
<br>
Not only this, we have more things for you.
